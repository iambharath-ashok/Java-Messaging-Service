# JMS - Java Messaging System

-	Most of the enterprise applications are using messaging concept 
-	For asynchronous communication between heterogeneous applications using JMS or AMQP


## JMS

-	JMS is the acronym for Java Messaging System
-	JMS is part of Java EE
-	JMS API is the implementation to handle the heterogeneous producer-consumer problem
-	JMS API allows us to create, send, receive, and read messages
-	Some of the benefits of using JMS are:
	– 	loosely coupled application
	-	reliability
	-	asynchronous communication
	
	
## What is Message?

-	The message is a piece of information or bytes of data that needs to transfered from one system to another
-	It can be a text, XML document, JSON data or an Entity (Java Object) etc
- 	The message is very useful data to communicate between different systems

## What is Messaging?

-	Messaging is a system that wants to send/receive the messages 
-	Messaging means exchanging information between different components in the same system or different systems
-	It can happen in either a synchronous manner or an asynchronous manner


## What is JMS?

-	JMS stands for Java Message Service
-	JMS  is a Java API which contains a common set of interfaces to implement enterprise based messaging systems
-	JMS API is used to implement Messaging systems in Java-based applications only
-	It does not support other languages
-	JMS API is used to create, send, receive and read messages or exchange messages between different systems
-	Once we develop a Java Messaging System with JMS API, then we can deploy the same application in any JMS Provider software

## JMS Advantages

-	Loosely Coupled: We can develop loosely coupled applications very easily
-	Asynchronous: 
	-	We can develop asynchronous messaging applications very easily
	-	That means JMS Sender can send messages and continue on its own work
	-	It does not wait for the completion of message consumption by JMS Receiver	
-	Robust and Reliable: 
	-	JMS ensures that a message is delivered one and only once to the destination system
	-	So we can develop reliable applications very easily
-	Interoperability:
	-	JMS API allows Interoperability between other Java Platform languages like Scala and Groovy	
	
## JMS Components

-	1.	JMS Client: Java program used to send (or produce or publish) or receive (or consume or subscribe) messages
	-	JMS Sender: JMS Client which is used to send messages to the destination system
		-	JMS sender is also known as JMS Producer or JMS Publisher
	-	JMS Receiver: JMS Client which is used to receive messages from Source system
		-	JMS Receiver is also known as JMS Consumer or JMS Subscriber
		
-	2.	JMS Provider: JMS API is a set of common interfaces, which does not contain any implementation
	-	JMS Provider is a third-party system who is responsible to implement the JMS API to provide messaging features to the clients
	-	JMS Provider is also known as MOM (Message Oriented Middleware) software or Message Broker or JMS Server or Messaging Server
	-	JMS Provider also provides some UI components to administrate and control this MOM software
	
-	3.	JMS Administered Objects: JMS Objects which are preconfigured by an administrator for the use of JMS clients
	-	They are ConnectionFactory and Destination Objects
	-	ConnectionFactory: ConnectionFactory object is used to create a connection between Java Application and JMS Provider
		-	It is used by Application to communicate with JMS Provider
	-	Destination: Destinations are also JMS Objects used by a JMS Client to specify the destination of messages 
		-	It is sending and the source of messages it receives
		-	There are two types of Destinations:
		-	Queue and Topic.
	
- 	4.	JMS Message: an object that contains the data being transferred between JMS clients


##	JMS Messaging Models: Point-To-Point and Publish/Subscribe

-	JMS API supports two kinds of Messaging models (Programming models) to support Asynchronous Messaging between Heterogeneous Systems.

	-	Point-To-Point Model(P2P Model)
	-	Publish-Subscribe Model(Pub/Sub Model)
	
###	Point-to-Point Messaging Model	

-	Point-to-Point Messaging Model is also known as P2P Model
-	JMS Receiver sends acknowledgements to JMS Sender once it receives message

-	How a P2P Model works?

	-	P2P Model uses “Queue” as JMS Destination
	-	In P2P Model, a JMS Sender or JMS Producer creates and sends messages to a Queue
	-	JMS Queue is an administered object, which is created in a JMS Provider by Administrator
	-	In P2P Model, a JMS Receiver or JMS Consumer receives and reads messages from a Queue
	-	In P2P Model, a JMS Message is delivered to one and only one JMS Consumer
		-	We can configure any number of JMS Senders and JMS Receivers to a particular queue
		-	However, any message should be delivered to one and only one Receiver
	-	There is no timing dependency between JMS Sender and JMS receiver
		-	That means the JMS Receiver can consume the messages whether it is alive or not when the JMS Sender sent that message
	-	In this model, Destination stores messages till its consumed by Receiver

###	Publish/Subscribe Messaging Model
	
	-	Durable Messaging Model: Durable Model is also known as Persistent Messaging Model
		-	In this model, Messages are stored in some kind of store in JMS Server until they are delivered to the destination properly
	-	Non-Durable Messaging Model: Non-Durable Model is also known as Non-Persistent Messaging Model
		-	In this model, Messages are not stored in the JMS Server
		
-	How Pub/Sub Model Works

	-	Pub/Sub model uses Topic as JMS Destination
	-	JMS Administrator uses JMS Provider Admin Console and configures all required ConnectionFactory and Topics Objects in JMS Provider.
	-	JMS Publisher creates and publishes messages to Topics.
	-	JMS Subscriber subscribes to interested Topics and consumes all messages.
	-	Pub/Sub Messaging model has timing dependency
		-	That means JMS Subscriber can consume messages which are published to the Topic only after it subscribes to that Topic
		-	Any messages posted before its subscription or any messages posted when it is inactive, cannot be delivered to that Consumer.
	-	Unlike P2P Model, in this model Destination does not store messages

-	Acknowledgement is not required
-	Just like P2P Model, Pub/Sub model also contains many possible architectures:

	-	One Publisher and many Subscribers
	-	Many Publishers and one Subscriber
	-	Many Publishers and many Subscribers	
	

	
## JMS Administered Objects

-	JMS API provides two kinds of Administered Objects to the JMS Clients
	
	-	Connection Factory
	-	Destination
	
-	JMS System Administrator creates these two Administered objects in JMS Provider (Message Broker) by using Application Server (AS) admin console
-	These two objects are stored in AS JNDI Directory or JNDI Registry

	-	Destination: Destination object is used to exchange messages between JMS Clients
		-	JMS API provides two kinds of Destinations:
			-	Queue
			-	Topic

	-	Connection Factory: Connection Factory object is used to create connection between JMS Provider and JMS Client
		-	When JMS Client (JMS Sender or JMS Receiver) lookups this object from JNDI Registry
		-	Then JMS Client receives one Connection object that is nothing but a physical connection between JMS Provider and JMS Client
		-	By using this connection, JMS Client can communicate with Destination object to send or receive messages into Queue or Topic
		-	While creating these two objects, we need to provide three things
			
			-	Name :- Name of the object. We can provide any valid name
			-	JNDI Name:- This is JNDI name which is used to register this object in JNDI Directory
				-	JMS Clients uses this name to lookup these objects from JNDI Registry 
				-	And use them in their applications to send or receive messages from JMS Provider
			-	Resource Type:- We need to specify the resource type here
			
		  S.NO.		ADMINISTERED OBJECTS	RESOURCE TYPE
			1.		ConnectionFactory		javax.jms.ConnectionFactory
			2.		Queue					javax.jms.Queue
			3.		Topic					javax.jms.Topic	
	
	-	Message 
		-	JMS Messages are used by JMS clients to exchange information between systems
		-	JMS Message is of type javax.jms.Message
			-	JMS Message is divided into 3 parts:
				-	Message Header
				-	Message Properties
				-	Message Body

			-	Message Header:
				-	This section is mandatory. 
				-	It contains predefined name-value pairs 
				-	Used by JMS Clients and JMS Providers to identify and route messages
				-	Predefined Headers:

						JMSDestination
						JMSDeliveryMode
						JMSMessageID
						JMSTimestamp
						JMSCorrelationID
						JMSReplyTo
						JMSRedelivered
						JMSType
						JMSExpiration
						JMSPriority
			
			-	Message Body:	
				-	This section is optional. It contains actual message sent from JMS Sender to JMS Receiver
				-	It supports the following message formats:

						TextMessage
						ObjectMessage
						BytesMessage
						StreamMessage
						MapMessage




##	JMS Architecture and JMS API Architecture


-	Common Steps in a Messaging System:
	-	System Administrator uses JMS Provider provided Admin Console and configures all required administered objects like ConnectionFactory and Destinations in JNDI Repository of JMS Provider.
	-	Application Developer writes Producer and Consumer application and deploy it into Server.
	-	When client access JMS Sender component(program), JMS Sender lookups Administered Objects from JMS Provider JNDI Register and send messages to the Destination (example Queue).
	-	JMS Destination (either Queue or Topic) holds all JMS Messages (which are sent by JMS Sender) until they are consumed by Consumer.
	-	When client access JMS Receiver component(program), JMS Receiver lookups Administered Objects from JMS Provider JNDI Register and receive messages from the Destination (example Queue).
	-	If the Messaging system(that is Server) crashes for some reasons, then System Administrator uses JMS Provider Admin Console to monitor, find the root cause of the problem, and restore messages into JMS Destinations.
	-	If there are any undelivered JMS Messages in Destinations (because of some Message Contract between Messaging systems), then System Administrator uses JMS Provider Admin Console to fix those message contract issues and re-send them into Destinations so that target Consumer can receive those messages and process them.
	-	If we use Durable or Persistent Destinations, then JMS Server uses JMS Stores to store undelivered messages.
	-	Durable or Persistent Destination stores messages until they deliver to all Subscribers and receive ACK from them.
	-	JMS Stores may be some kind of Flat Data files or some JMS Servers uses some kind of databases to store messages.
	- 	Flat Data files may be XML files or text files.
	

-	High-Level JMS Architecture

	-	Java Application -> JMS API -> JMS Provider
	-	JAVA Sender Application uses JMS API to create Connection with JMS Server, create JMS Message and Send those to Destination.
	-	In the same way, JAVA Receiver Application uses JMS API to create Connection with JMS Server, receive JMS Message and Send ACK (Acknowledgement) to Sender

-	Low-Level JMS Architecture
	
	-	Java Application -> JMS API -> JMS Provider -> JBOSS/WEBLogic/ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ
	-	We can use same JMS Application in any JMS Provider with some minimal configurations at Server side
	
-	JMS API Architecture

	-	InitialContext -> ConnectionFactory -> Connection -> Session -> Destination -> Message -> Send Message -> Closing Connection
	
## JMS API Overview: JMS 1.x and JMS 2.x

-	JMS API V.1.0/1.0.1/1.02 is also known as Legacy API
-	It is not recommended to use this API to implement Messaging system
-	JMS V.1.1 API is also known as Classic API
-	JMS V.1.1 API has introduced only one common API to develop both Messaging models very easily
-	JMS API had updated to V.2.0 as part of Java EE 7 release
-	This new JMS V.2.0 API is also known as Simplified API
	-	JMS 2.0 has improved previous version to reduce the creation of more objects
	-	Provided new set of methods to ease of development 
	-	Also to support Java EE new features like Annotations and Generics
	-	It also renamed some interface names for better readability and to avoid confusions
	
		ConnectionFactory
		JMSContext
		Destination
		Message
		JMSConsumer
		JMSProducer
		JMSRuntimeException
		
	-	ConnectionFactory -> JMSContext -> JMSProducer/JMSConsumer -> Destination -> Message -> Send/Receive Message	
	


## JMS API 2.0 Producer and Consumer

-	JMS 2.0 has provided Simplified API to avoid the creation of more objects
-	Steps to develop JMS V.2.0 Producer:

	-	InitialContext -> ConnectionFactory -> Destination -> JMSContext -> JMSProducer -> Send Message
	
		Context context = new InitialContext ();
		ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup ("jms/SampleConnectionFactory");
		Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup ("jms/SampleQueue");
		JMSContext jmsContext = cf.createContext();
		jmsContext.createProducer().send(queue, " JD Sample Text Message");
		jmsContext.close();

-	Steps to develop JMS V.2.0 Receiver:
	
	-	InitialContext -> ConnectionFactory -> Destination -> JMSContext -> JMSReceiver -> Receiver Message
	
		Context context = new InitialContext ();
		ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup ("jms/SampleConnectionFactory");
		Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup ("jms/SampleQueue");
		JMSContext jmsContext = cf.createContext();
		String message = jmsContext.createConsumer(queue).receiveBody(String.class);
		jmsContext.close();

		</config>
		
-	Configure in-memory server ConnectionFactory and Queue “hornetq-jms.xml” to run this program
	-	It is used to configure JMS Settings
	-	Here we have configured ConnectionFactory with “JDConnectionFactory” name and Queue destination with “/queue/JDQueue” JNDI name
	-	We have linked these two things to previous configured JBoss HornetQ In-Memory Server
	-	hornetq-jms.xml
		
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<configuration xmlns="urn:hornetq"

-	Create a Simple Java class “EmbeddedHornetQJMSExample”

			package com.jd.embedded.jms.hornetq;

			import javax.jms.*;
			import org.hornetq.jms.server.embedded.EmbeddedJMS;

			public class EmbeddedHornetQJMSExample
			{
			   public static void main(final String[] args)
			   {
				  try
				  {
					 // This EmbeddedJMS class acts as a JMSServer for example: JBoss HornetQ Server
					 EmbeddedJMS jmsServer = new EmbeddedJMS();
					 jmsServer.start();
					 System.out.println("JD: Embedded JMS Server started.");
					 ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = 
								(ConnectionFactory)jmsServer.lookup("JDConnectionFactory");
					 Queue queue = (Queue)jmsServer.lookup("/queue/JDQueue");
					 Connection connection = null;
					 try
					 {
						connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
						Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
						
						//1. Producer Code Start
						MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
						TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("Hello, I'm from JournalDev(JD).");
						System.out.println("Sending message: " + message.getText());
						producer.send(message);
						
						//2. Consumer Code Start
						MessageConsumer messageConsumer = session.createConsumer(queue);
						connection.start();
						TextMessage messageReceived = (TextMessage)messageConsumer.receive(1000);
						System.out.println("Received message: " + messageReceived.getText());
					 }
					 finally
					 {
						if (connection != null)
						{
						   connection.close();
						}

						jmsServer.stop();
						System.out.println("JD: Embedded JMS Server stopped.");
					 }
				  }
