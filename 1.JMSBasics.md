# 	JMS - Java Messaging Service

## What is message?

-	Message is a piece of information or bytes of data
-	Messages are used to send information from one system to another system
-	System may run in same environment or may be different environment

## What is Messaging?

-	System that send messages to another system is called messaging system
-	Message is a communication b/w systems in distributed environment
-	Systems in distributed environment are loosely coupled with each other
-	COBRA, TCP Sockets, RMI are tightly coupled with other


## Advantages of Messaging

-	Ability to integrate different platforms in a loosely coupled fashion
-	Different platforms can talk to each other
-	Doesn't matter who's sending the message and who's consuming the messages
-	Increases scalability 
	
	-	Can increase any number of Producers and Consumers
-	Reliability of message delivery
	-	A message is guaranteed to deliver once and only once


## What is JMS?

- 	JMS is a Java Message Oriented Middle-ware api for sending messages b/w two or more clients
-	Jms is like broker or postman, agent
-	Jms recieves the messages from one end and sends those messages to one or more clients
-	Jms is part of Java Enterprise Edition
-	Jms is a specification for Jms implementors
	-	Jms specification will be implemented by 
		-	Rabbit MQ
		-	Active MQ
		-	Hornet Queue
		-	IBM MQ

-	Loosely coupled communication b/w differnt systems
-	Asynchronous communication b/w sender and reciever
-	Reliable delivery 

## JMS Application

-	Typical JMS application will atleast one Message sender and atleast messaage reciever
-	Messaging Queue(MQ) will sit b/w sender and reciver
-	MQ can be any Messaging Queue Provider

	-	Active MQ	
	-	Rabbit MQ
	
	
	
## JMS b/w Java Mail

Java Email

-	Java Mail is a API for sending Email, reading Emails
-	Java Mail is for human to human exchange
-	Email delivery can be duplicated or not guaranteed
-	Email is designed for connectivity on the web by human activity


JMS

-	JMS is a API for sending messages b/w systems
-	Systems can be Inter/Intra Company
-	Messaging systems can be Application/Human to application/human messaging
-	Message delivery will not be duplicated and message delivery is guaranteed
	- 	JMS is like DB 
		-	Messages will be drained if and only if receiver reads it
-	Jms has different qualities
	-	durable vs non-durable
	-	Queue vs Topic
	-	High Performance and highly fault tolerant
	-	Low latency 
	-	Reliability with message loss and avoiding duplicates
	
	

## Jms Components 

-	JMS Provider
	
	-	Messaging System that implements JMS specification
	-	Acts as MOM(Message Oriented Middle-ware) 
	-	JMS Specification Implementations: 
	
		Active MQ, Rabbit MQ, Hornet MQ, IBM MQ, JBOSS MQ
	
	
-	JMS Clients

	-	Java Applications that produces and consumes messages

	
-	JMS Producers/ Publisher 
	
	-	Clients that produces or sends messages
	
-	JMS Consumers/ Subscriber:
	
	-	Client that receives messages
	
-	JMS Application

	-	System composed of many clients and consumers
	
	

## Messaging Models

-	PTP (Point-To-Point)
	-	Built around concept of Queue (FIFO)
	-	Each message will received by only one client at a time
	-	There can be multiple Consumer configured but only one Consumer can receive the message
	-	In PTP Receiver will acknowledge the message to Queue
	
	
-	Pub/Sub(Publish/ Subscribe)
	
	-	Persistent (Durable)
		-	Will use DB in b/w to save all the incoming messages
		
	-	Non-Persistent (Non-Durable)
		-	In Non-Durable, messages will be delivered to who ever available in online
		
	
	-	Each message will have multiple consumers
	-	Pub/Sub will Topic as the broker 
	-	Publisher will send messages to Topic 
	-	Single Topic can be subscribed by many consumers
	-	Each message published to a topic is a broadcast to all the clients that subscribe to that topic
	
	
## PTP vs Pub/Sub

-	Point to Point
		
	-	Each message has only one consumers
	-	Messages are first sent to destination called Queue
	-	Receiver and Producer doesn't have timing dependency
	-	Receiver can consume the messages whether its running or not at the time of Producer sending the messages
	-	Receiver acknowledges on successful receiving of messages
	
-	Pub/Sub
	
	-	Each message can have multiple Consumers
	-	Messages are first sent to destination called Topic
	-	Receiver and Producer doesn't have timing dependency in Kafka
	-	Receiver doesn't acknowledges on successful receiving of messages
		

		
		
## JMS Programming Models

-	ConnectionFactory -> Connection -> Session ->  Message Producer/ Consumer -> Send/Receive 

	Code Snippet of JMS Client:
		

		InitialContext context = new InitialContext();		
		// Lookup for Connection Factory
		ConnectionFactory factory = context.lookup(connectionFactoryName);
		
		//Create Connection
		Connection connection = factory.createConnection();
		
		// Create Session
		Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
		
		// Create Destination Object 
		Destination destination1 = (Queue) context.lookup("/jms/myQueue");// for Point-To-Point
		Destination destination2 = (Topic) context.lookup("/jms/myTopic"); // for publish/subscribe
		
		// Create consumer
		MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(destination1);
		connection.start();
		Message m = consumer.receive();
				
	Code Snippet of JMS Producer:

		
		InitialContext context = new InitialContext();		
		// Lookup for Connection Factory
		ConnectionFactory factory = context.lookup(connectionFactoryName);
		
		//Create Connection
		Connection connection = factory.createConnection();
		
		// Create Session
		Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
		
		
		//Creating Producer
		MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination1);
		
		// Create Message
		Message message = session.createTextMessage();
		message.setText("Just Another Message");
		
		// Sending Message
		producer.send(message);
		
		//Closing Connection
		connection.close();
		
		
## Two ways of creating the	Consumers

-	Synchronous Messaging
	
	-	In synchronous messaging, server will wait for consumer to respond
	-	If one of the end is down then entire communication will fail
	
-	Asynchronous Messaging
	-	In asynchronous messaging, Producer end will not wait for consumer receive
	-	An event is used to trigger a message from a server
	-	Listener is used along with consumer to receive asynchronously
	-	Even if consumer is down, messaging will complete successfully
	
	
	Code Snippet of Asynchronous Consumer:
	
		InitialContext context = new InitialContext();
		
		ConnectionFactory factory = context.lookup(connectionFactoryName);
		Connection connection = factory.createConnection();
		
		Session session  = connection.createSession();
		MessageConsmer consumer = session.createConsumer();
		
		MessageListener listener = new myListener();	
		consumer.setMessageListener(listener);
		
		// Listener should have a method onMessage() in its implementation
		
		public void onMessage(Message message) {
			// Read the message and do computation
		}

		
## JMS Integration Framework

-	Spring provides JMS integration framework that simplifies the use of JMS API like Spring JDBC API
-	Instead of writing a boiler plate and low level api code ... Spring JMS integration framework provides a template
	-	Using Spring JMS Template we can produce and consume the messages

-	With Spring JMS Integration framework, functionality is roughly divided into two parts
	-	Production of Messages
	-	Consumption of Messages

- 	JmsTemplate class can be used for production of messages and consumption of synchronous messages
-	For asynchronous reception, spring provides number of message listener containers that are used to create Message-Driver Pojo's(MDPs)





## JMS Integration with ActiveMQ without Spring 

-	Steps to JMS with Active MQ 

	-	1.	Add Active MQ dependency 
		-	activemq-all-5.4.3.jar
		-	org.springframework.jms-3.0.1.jar
	-	2.	Create Messaging Producer with low level API code
		-	Send some messages to Queue or Topic
	-	3.	Create Messaging Consumer with low level API Code
		-	Consumer messages from Queue or Topic
		
	Code Snippet of Producer Sending message to Active MQ 
	
	
		public class MessageProducer {
				
			public static void main() {
				try{
				
					ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://Toshiba:61616");
			
					Connection connection = factory.createConnection();
					
					connection.start();
					
					Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
					
					Destination destination = session.createQueue("HELLOWORLD.TESTQ");
					
					MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(destination);
					producer.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.NON-PERSISTENT);
					
					String message = "Hello World From: " + Thread.currentThread().getName();
					TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage(message);
					
					producer.send(message);
					
					session.close();
					connection.close();
				
				} catch(Exception e) {
					e.printStackTrace();
				}
			}		
		}
		
		
		public class MessageConsumer {
		
			public static void main() {
				
				ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://Toshiba:61616");
				Connection connection = factory.createConnection();
				connection.start();
				
				Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
				Destination destination = session.createTopic("HELLOWORLD.TESTQ");
				
				MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(destination);
				
				Message message = consumer.receive(1000);
				
				if(message instanceof TextMessage) {
					TextMessage tMessage = (TextMessage) message;
					String text = tMessage.getText();				
				}
				session.close();
				connection.close();
			}
			
		
		}
		
		
## JMS Integration with ActiveMQ using Spring 

-	Steps to configure Active MQ with Spring
	
	-	Create ActiveMQConnectionFactory Bean in spring-configure.xml
	-	Create JmsTemplate in the spring-configure.xml
	-	Create ApplicationContext with ClassPathXMLApplicationContext("spring-configure.xml");
	-	Get the jmsTemplate bean from spring application context
	-	Send message Active MQ Broker using Spring-JMS template
	
	Code Snippet of Spring Configuration
	
	
		<beans>
		
			<bean id="connectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory">
				<constructor-arg value="failover:(tcp://localhost:61616)">
			</bean>	
			
			
			<bean id="jmsTemplate" class="org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate">
				<constructor-arg ref="connectionFactory"/>
				<property name="sessionTransacted" value="false"/>
				<property name="receiveTimeout" value="5000"/>
			</bean>	
			
		</beans>
		
		
		public class JmsTemplateTest {
		
			public static main() {
			
				ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring-configure.xml");
				
				JmsTemplate template = (JmsTemplate) ctx.getBean("jmsTemplate");
				
				template.send("SpringSendTestQueue", new MessageCreator(){
					
					
					@Override
					public Message createMessage(Session session) throws JmsException {
					
						TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage();
						message.setText("This is the message");
						return message;
					}
				
				
				});
			
			}
		
		}

## Actors in Java Messaging Model

-	JMS Producer
-	JMS Consumer
-	JMS Message
-	JMS Administered Objects
-	JMS Provider

	-	Based on our application or client needs, we can use any available JMS Provider to implement Messaging Application
	-	JMS Administrator configures all required Administered Objects in JMS Provider Admin console to use them in our application
	-	Popular JMS Providers are 
		-	Active MQ
		-	Rabbit MQ
		
	
## Steps to Create JMS Producer

	InitialContext -> ConnectionFactory -> Connection -> Session -> MessageProducer -> Message -> Send Message
	
	Code Snippet:
	
		Context context = new InitialContext ();
		ConnectionFactory cf = (ConnectionFactory) context.lookup ("jms/SampleConnectionFactory");
		Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup ("jms/SampleQueue");
		Connection connection = cf.createConnection ();
		Session session = connection.createSession (false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
		MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
		TextMessage txtMsg = session.createTextMessage ("Sample P2P Queue TextMessage");
		producer.send (message);
		connection.close();

## Steps to Create JMS Consumer
	
	InitialContext -> ConnectionFactory -> Connection -> Session -> MessageConsumer -> Message -> Receive Message
	
	Code Snippet:
		
		Context context = new InitialContext ();
		ConnectionFactory cf = ConnectionFactory) context.lookup ("jms/SampleConnectionFactory");
		Destination queue = (Destination) context.lookup ("jms/SampleQueue");
		Session session = connection.createSession (false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
		MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue);
		connection.start();
		TextMessage message = (TextMessage) consumer.receive();
		connection.close();


-	Making a connection.start() method call is required at Consumer end, but not required at Producer end
-	When Producer makes a call to send() method
	-	It will automatically start connection between Producer and Messaging Provider(Like JBoss)
-	Consumers should make a call to connection.start() method 
	-	Because Consumers should inform to Messaging Provider saying that they are ready to receive or consume messages
-	Message delivery from JMS Provider to Consumer does not begin until consumer starts the connection by calling its start() method
